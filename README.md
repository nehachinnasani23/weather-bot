##Project Explanation: Weather Bot ðŸŒ¦
  -**Overview**:
The Weather Bot is a web application designed to fetch and display real-time weather information for cities worldwide. It offers a user-friendly and responsive interface while demonstrating robust backend functionality with Flask. Users can search for weather data of multiple cities, view local times specific to the cities, and interact with a dynamically styled interface that adapts to different weather conditions.

This project is a strong portfolio addition, showcasing technical proficiency in full-stack web development, API integration, and user-centric design.

-**Goals of the Project**:
API Integration: Learn how to interact with third-party APIs (OpenWeather API) to fetch and display live data.
Dynamic Content Rendering: Implement responsive and dynamic UI elements to enhance user experience.
Error Handling: Provide clear, informative feedback to users when errors occur.
Theming and Styling: Demonstrate creative styling for different weather conditions.
Practical Application: Build a project that simulates real-world application development, suitable for a professional portfolio.
How It Works
User Input:

Users enter city names (single or multiple) into the search bar.
They can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature units.
Data Fetching:

The app sends a request to the OpenWeather API.
It retrieves detailed weather information, such as:
Temperature
Weather description
Humidity
Wind speed
Visibility
Sunrise and sunset times
The app also calculates the local time for the searched city.
Dynamic Response:

The app renders the weather data in a visually appealing section.
Styling adapts to the weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).
Error messages are displayed for invalid or missing inputs.
